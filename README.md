# Backstory

I butchered some Xbox controllers last month, Two of the classic Xbox Ones' to be exact.
I wanted one with bluetooth capabilities, 
Not needlessly, so I could use the controllers BT to link with my phone and play with a modded controller.
Sorry, let me clarify that a little more, So I could play multiplayer games with an auto-trigger and mess players up with the 
smg classes. Now some of you out there might say that this was overkill. Yes, I'll agree. There's a hundred other things that 
Picos have been used on or in that would have been a better fit for the board but no, I just had to get 
I could have bought a fancy new controller or done something with a 555timer but in the 
spirit of DIY I used what I had. 

Alrighty so, which controller has Bluetooth?
There are, at this point of writing, three diferent versions of the regular Xbox One controller: 1537, 1697 and 1708. 
Only the last of these the lovely 1708 has Bluetooth built-in, meaning it can be easily used with laptops, smart TVs and phones.


"Which Xbox One controller is Bluetooth
In short, if the section with the Xbox Guide button is the same material as the shoulder triggers, you’re using an older 1697 pad. If it’s the same plastic as the front of the controller, then – happy days! – you’ve got a 1708 model, and can pair it with pretty much anything using the Bluetooth standard."

You can always just open the battery compartment and you’ll almost always find the model number on the sticker. 

Here’s my non-Bluetooth 1697 model:(V1.1 - V2.3)
